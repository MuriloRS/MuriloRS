### Hello, world!
Senior Fullstack Software Engineer

I'm a Software Engineer at Loft, one of the biggest startups in Brazil, where I specialize in React, Next.js and TypeScript, working mainly with squads focused on the top of the funnel. I collaborate closely with the product team, performing A/B tests, implementing automated tests and monitoring. This participation allows me to optimize the user experience, boost conversion rates and contribute to the development process by incorporating best practices.
